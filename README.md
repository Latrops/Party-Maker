This is an exam application at Softheme iOS internship 2016

Obviously, server-side of application is down now, so you can't play with it anymore.

Still a pretty nice month-lenght project that demonstrates work with some core frameworks like CoreLocation, CoreData etc. Also features using CocoaPods inside project, work with complexed constraints, work with remote server and a lot of other frequently-used stuff.
